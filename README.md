# GymLogs

## This is a React Native app for tracking and viewing your gym progress in time.

### Description

> *Oh man, I can't remember how much I lifted the last time I did this exercise!* - Probably me

Hard time keeping tracker of how much you lift in certain exercise? Want to see some cool graphics about them? I got the app for you, fam. 

### Overview

This React Native App uses the normal React Native CLI for running and building the project. The project persist data with AsyncStorage, and handles the state with [Jotai](https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai). The premise is simple:
- Add an exercise
- Add new entries every time you want to register a new record
- Update and delete...
- View the graphics to keep track of your gains in time
